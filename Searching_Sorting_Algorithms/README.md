# Bubble Sort vs Heap Sort Analyzer  

This project implements and compares two fundamental sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Heap Sort**.  
It provides a menu-driven console application where you can:  
- Generate random lists of integers  
- Sort them using Bubble Sort or Heap Sort  
- Analyze **best**, **average**, and **worst** case scenarios  
- Run performance benchmarks for input sizes of 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 elements  

The project also demonstrates how input distribution (ascending, descending, identical, or varied values) affects sorting performance.  
Useful for learning **time complexity** and the impact of data arrangement on sorting algorithms.  

# Exponential Search, Bogo Sort, and Stooge Sort Performance Explorer  

This project implements one search algorithm (**Exponential Search**) and two unconventional sorting algorithms (**Bogo Sort** and **Stooge Sort**).  
It provides an interactive console program to:  
- Generate random lists of integers  
- Perform Exponential Search on sorted lists  
- Experiment with Bogo Sort (random shuffling until sorted)  
- Test Stooge Sort (recursive triple-splitting sort)  
- Analyze **best**, **average**, and **worst** case performance  

The project measures runtime using lists of different sizes, helping visualize the impracticality of inefficient algorithms compared to logarithmic or quadratic approaches.  
Itâ€™s especially useful for educational purposes, showing why algorithm choice matters in computer science.
