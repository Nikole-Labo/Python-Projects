# Gomoku ‚Äì Five in a Row

An implementation of **Gomoku (Five in a Row)** in Python featuring both **console** and **graphical (Tkinter)** user interfaces. The game supports **player vs computer** gameplay, with an AI that can block, attempt to win, and play strategically. It also includes a **unit test suite** for verifying game logic.

## üéØ Features & Functionality

* **Two play modes**

  * Console-based UI (text input)
  * Tkinter GUI with a 15√ó15 board
* **Human vs AI gameplay**

  * Human plays with `X`
  * Computer plays with `O`
* **AI decision-making**

  * Attempts to win in one move
  * Blocks player‚Äôs winning moves
  * Prevents ‚Äú4 in a row‚Äù threats
  * Plays randomly when no immediate strategy is found
* **Game mechanics**

  * Win detection across rows, columns, and diagonals
  * Draw detection when the board is full
  * Restart option after win/loss/draw
* **GUI features**

  * Interactive 15√ó15 clickable board
  * Score tracking for player vs AI
  * Restart button with alternating first-move advantage
* **Unit tests** ensuring board validation, win conditions, draw detection, AI blocking, and AI winning logic

## üõ† Architecture & Flow

1. **Board (`board.py`)**

   * Maintains grid state and validates moves
   * Detects wins (rows, columns, diagonals) and draws
   * Resets board between games

2. **Service (`service.py`)**

   * Orchestrates game flow and AI strategy
   * Provides methods for blocking, winning, and random AI moves
   * Interfaces between board state and UI

3. **User Interfaces**

   * **Console UI (`ui.py` ‚Äì `UI` class & console starter)**

     * Text-based play loop with coordinate input
     * Displays board state after each move
   * **GUI (`ui.py` ‚Äì `GUI` class & gui starter)**

     * Tkinter-based interactive grid
     * Scoreboard and restart functionality

4. **Tests (`tests.py`)**

   * Validates move legality
   * Checks win conditions across all directions
   * Ensures AI correctly blocks or wins when possible
   * Confirms draw detection and board reset
