# 🐍 Python Fundamentals – Problem Solving Exercises

## 📘 Assignment Overview  
This assignment marked the beginning of my programming journey, focusing on solving **mathematical and logical problems** using Python.  

It consists of **six programs** that apply loops, conditionals, functions, and input validation to tackle challenges involving:  
- Prime numbers  
- Perfect numbers  
- Digit manipulation  
- Fibonacci sequences  
- Date calculations

## ✅ Tasks  

### 🔹 1. Largest Prime Number Smaller than a Given Number 
- Finds the largest prime number less than a user-provided natural number `n`.  
- Demonstrates **prime-checking logic**, iterative search, and user input handling.  

### 🔹 2. Twin Primes Larger than a Given Number 
- Identifies the first pair of twin primes `(p1, p2)` greater than a given `n`, where `p2 - p1 = 2`.  
- Implements **iterative logic** and **prime validation**.  

### 🔹 3. Largest Perfect Number Smaller than a Given Number  
- Determines the largest perfect number smaller than a given natural number `n`.  
- Reinforces **divisor summation logic** and mathematical validation.  

### 🔹 4. Largest Natural Number with the Same Digits
- Rearranges the digits of a given natural number to form the largest possible number.  
- Example: `3658 → 8653`.  

### 🔹 5. Smallest Fibonacci Number Larger than a Given Number
- Computes the smallest Fibonacci number greater than a user-provided natural number `n`.  
- Reinforces **iterative sequence generation** and comparisons.  

### 🔹 6. Age in Days  
- Calculates a person’s age in days given birthdate and current date.  
- Handles **leap years**, validates input, and avoids Python’s built-in date/time functions.
