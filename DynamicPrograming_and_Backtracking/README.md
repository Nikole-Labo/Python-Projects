# Coin Change Combinations Explorer  

This project explores the **coin change problem** using **backtracking** techniques.  
It provides a menu-driven console application that allows users to:  
- Input a list of coin denominations  
- Specify a target sum  
- Find all possible combinations of coins that sum up to the target  
- Compare **recursive** and **iterative** backtracking approaches  

Features include:  
- Displaying all valid coin combinations  
- Handling cases where no solution exists  
- Learning how backtracking efficiently explores possibilities while pruning invalid paths  

This project strengthens understanding of recursion, iterative backtracking, and combinatorial problem-solving.  

# Minimum Difference Set Partition  

This project solves the problem of **partitioning a set of positive integers** into two subsets such that the difference between their sums is minimized.  
The application offers two approaches:  
- **Naive Approach**: Evaluates all possible subset combinations  
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Efficiently finds a subset close to half of the total sum  

Users can:  
- Input a set of integers  
- Obtain at least one solution that minimizes the difference between subset sums  
- Compare naive and dynamic programming solutions in terms of efficiency  

This project helps develop skills in combinatorial optimization, dynamic programming, and algorithmic problem-solving.
